**Hey, I'm AndrÃ© Victor! ðŸ‘‹**

You can also call me Dezzy. I'm a Front-End Engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·  working remotely for [OTempo](https://otempo.com.br) with Vue.js and Nuxt.js. Lately, I'm making some cool applications with React, Next.js and Node.js. I also love sharing knowledge and contributing to Open Source projects.

If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me [an email](mailto:hello@andredezzy.com) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andredezzy) (the best way to talk with me). I'm looking forward to connecting with you :)
